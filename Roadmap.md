General plans for the roadmap (subject to change, etc)
======================

0.0.1 - 0.1.0:  Manual testing, etc.  APIs may be subject to change

During this phase, will probably make sure that things like geoiplite2
databases are supported.

0.1.0 - 1.0.0:  Improvements in automatic testing

For each supported database we will create some test files of bogus
test data using the MaxMind writer.
